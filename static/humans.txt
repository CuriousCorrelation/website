Gitpod is not opinionated. We integrate, don't dictate. Gitpod is an open
platform giving developers full transparency over how Gitpod works and allowing
everybody to contribute. Our product design integrates with all stacks giving 
developers full flexibility. We seek to collaborate and partner with other
products/companies that share these values.

We are a fully remote company with employees in 13 countries across 4 continents
that deeply value our community and develop Gitpod with Gitpod. Gitpod was
founded because we were frustrated by setting up and maintaining dev
environments. 

Our founding team has created development tools, programming languages and
grown open-source communities for the last 15 years. We have improved developer
tooling for companies such as Facebook, Apple and Ericsson.

Our goal is simple: Bring back joy and speed to dev workflows.
